query, store files for loading all models, loading faiss shot db, setting variables and calling sub functions



store:
 - extract isc features + store in folder.
 - ffmpeg shot detect (phash)
 - take 16 equally spaced frames per shot and extract embeddings using videomae?.
 - store each embedding in faiss shot db
 - update metadata file which has one entry per video with video_id, title, isc_features_path


query
 - extract isc features
 - shot detection
 - shot frame extraction
 - shot embeddings

 - create video_candidates set (videos we'll do transvcl comparisons on later)
 - for each shot:
    - search shot in db for top k similar shots
    - for each candidate shot, add video_id to video_candidates if not already in it

 - for each video in video_candidates
   - run compare_isc_features (TransVCL) and add to predictions 

 - Keep top k predictions or predictions above threshold.

 - Print out results


functions needed: 
 - extract_isc_features (return vectors), 
 - store_isc_features (takes vectors and store them in file)
 - compare_isc_features (takes two vector arrays and runs transvcl process to get predictions)
