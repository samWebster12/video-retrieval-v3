- add option to save videomae embeddings (for later reference)
- add option to skip videomae and isc embedding extraction if file already exists 
- create web version
- running TransVCL on long videos (hours) prob don't work so well because 2d image gets so big. maybe only do on +- detected shot depending on size of input?
- transvcl kind of sucks. Consider using 2d similarity map of super embeddings and training new object detection model to detect alignments.
